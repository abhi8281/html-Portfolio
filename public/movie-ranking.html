<h1>The Best Movies According to Abhishek</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>KGF 2</h3>
<p>The dialogues are great once again, Performances from Yash, Sanjay Dutt & Raveena Tandon were superb. 
    Great Cinematography & Music that evokes the emotions.
     The romantic angle is better in this one & the great emotional bond of Mother & Son is once again central to the plot.</p>


<h3>3 idiots</h3>
<p>In college, Farhan and Raju form a great bond with Rancho due to his positive and refreshing outlook to life.
     Years later, a bet gives them a chance to look for their long-lost friend whose existence seems rather elusive.</p>

<h3>Chennai Express</h3>
<p>A man's (Shahrukh Khan) trip to fulfill his 
    late grandfather's last wish turns into an unexpected adventure when he meets a unique young woman (Deepika Padukone) from southern India.</p>
